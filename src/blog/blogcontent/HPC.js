Learning to decompose problems, manage data distribution, and orchestrate communication between independent processes across a cluster was a steep but rewarding climb. Setting up the underlying network infrastructure, specifically in my home base of Davis, involved grappling with low-latency interconnects like InfiniBand and optimizing communication patterns – critical lessons for any large-scale HPC endeavor."

This just-in-time (JIT) compiler transforms numerical Python code into fast machine code, often leveraging SIMD instructions and even generating CUDA/ROCm kernels directly from Python. Numba has been instrumental in accelerating bespoke numerical routines in my trading strategies and in pre/post-processing steps for QMCPACK, allowing me to maintain Python's flexibility without sacrificing performance."

Understanding how to configure network switches, optimize routing, and minimize communication overhead became as crucial as optimizing the code itself.
